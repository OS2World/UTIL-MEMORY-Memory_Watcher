  with this Memory Watcher produce a print out of the memory
status. This is usefull if one wants to Telnet to another OS/2
machine and get it's memory status. In order for this to work
you must redirect the output to a file, this is done by using
the >filename.ext parameter.
Eg. the following produce a file memwatch.txt with the memory
status on the OS/2 machine where Memory Watcher was started:

memwatch.exe -s >memwatch.txt
